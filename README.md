# GameJam2023_TheNorthernRegalia
A 48H-long Game Jam Project

The Northern Regalia takes place in a dark-fantasy world.
The Lord Regalius has started to summon demons and chimeras in order to take control of the realm. 
And there you are : a mighty knight who already saved the world multiple times and got bored of 
seeing the same evil plans everywhere he goes. 

Your mission is simple : Get to the castle, 
find Regalius. Put a term to his plans.
